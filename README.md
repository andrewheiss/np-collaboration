# Instructions

Each player is randomly distributed 1 resource and 5 objectives. Objectives are fulfilled when they are associated with a resource of the same letter. Individuals accrue points associated with the value (V) of fulfilled objectives. Society gets social value associated with the social value (S) of fulfilled objectives.

Play each variation below, and compare conditions in which a) players seek to maximize V and b) players seek to maximize S. For live games, these will require different screens. For simulations, it is simply a matter of altering the decision patterns. For simulations, continue each round until Pareto optimality is reached. Track starting and ending values for V and S in each round. For live games, play continues until each player clicks the "done" button.

For additional variations, alter the distribution of quantities (Q1 and Q2) and values (V) above, and/or alter the number of players and/or objectives distributed per person.

# Variations

Variation 1: Players may "network" with other players to access other players' resources and achieve their own objectives. Players are aware of the resources others have to offer, but not the objectives of others. To network with another player, both players must agree and the requesting player must drop one objective of their choice and leave it unfulfilled.
                                                                             
Variation 2: Players may "network" with other players to access other players' resources and achieve their own objectives. Players are aware of the resources others have to offer, but not the objectives of others. To network with another player, a player must offer one objective of their choice as payment, and the other player must accept the offer.
                                                                             
Variation 3: Players may "network" with other players to access other players' resources and achieve their own objectives. Players are aware of the resources others have to offer, but not the objectives of others. To network with another player, both players must agree to network.
                                                                             
Variation 4: Players may "network" with other players to access other players' resources and achieve their own objectives. Players are aware of the resources others have to offer, but not the objectives of others. To network with another player, both players must agree to network. Each player has a limit of one network partner.
